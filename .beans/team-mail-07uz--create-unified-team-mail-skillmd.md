Create a comprehensive SKILL.md that consolidates all command functionality into a single skill file. Should include:
- Plugin purpose and when to use
- Core concepts (agents, identity, authentication, messages)
- All CLI commands with examples
- Common workflows (identity, discovery, messaging, admin)
- Environment variables
- Error handling tips

This becomes the single source of truth for the Claude plugin.

## Summary of Changes

Created a comprehensive unified SKILL.md that consolidates all functionality from the 11 separate command files:
- Environment variables table
- Complete CLI reference organized by category (Setup, Discovery, Identity, Messaging)
- Common workflows (First-Time Setup, Register Agent, Check Identity, Find Teammates, Send Message, Broadcast, Check Messages, Update Status)
- Error handling section with troubleshooting steps
- Tips for effective usage
